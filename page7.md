## Article 7 - Setting Device Ownership by Primary Extension

This article covers setting device device ownership information by using the association between the telephone number allocated to the end user in the *enduser* table and the Directory Number assigned to the primary line of telephone devices in the *device* table.

using data stored in a CSV generated by the Python script in the previous article.

To do this we will use a Python script to submit SQL update queries to the CUCM API using device and owner information read from the CSV file.

### SQL Query Used to Select User Data from enduser Table

The SQL query we will use to get user information from the *enduser* table is shown below.
```
SELECT pkid, userid, telephonenumber FROM enduser ORDER BY userid
```
The query selects the following information:
- **pkid** - the primary key for the user.
- **userid** - the CUCM user ID for the user.
- **telephonenumber** - the telephone number assigned to the user.

### SQL Query Used to Set Device Ownership by Primary Extension

The SQL query we will use to set the device owner by primary extension is shown below.
```
UPDATE device SET fkenduser = "fkenduser" WHERE pkid IN (SELECT fkdevice FROM devicenumplanmap WHERE fknumplan = (SELECT pkid FROM numplan WHERE dnorpattern = "telephonenumber") AND numplanindex = 1) AND tkclass = '1'
```
This query will just once as there *where* conditions will match all user type phones.

### The Python Script
The Python script shown below will retrieve the data listed above and save it to a CSV file. The name of the CSV file includes date and time information so that new output files can be created without overwriting existing files.

The script comprises the following high level steps:

1. Load information needed to connect to the target CUCM server from an ini file.
2. Connect to the CUCM AXL API using the settings from the and set *fkenduser* value to NULL for all user type phones (not CTI ports or BAT template devices).

```

```
