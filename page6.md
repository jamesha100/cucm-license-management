## Article 6 - Clearing Device Ownership Data

This article covers restoring device ownership information using data stored in a CSV generated by the Python script in the previous article.

To do this we will use a Python script to submit SQL update queries to the CUCM API using device and owner information read from the CSV file.

### SQL Query Used to clear Device Ownership Data

The SQL query we will use to clear the device owner data is shown below.
```
run sql update device set fkenduser = NULL where pkid = 'value_of_pkid_read_from_csv_file'
```
This query will just once as there *where* conditions will match all user type phones.

### The Python Script
The Python script shown below will retrieve the data listed above and save it to a CSV file. The name of the CSV file includes date and time information so that new output files can be created without overwriting existing files.

The script comprises the following high level steps:

1. Load information needed to connect to the target CUCM server from an ini file.
2. Connect to the CUCM AXL API using the settings from the and set *fkenduser* value to NULL for all user type phones (not CTI ports or BAT template devices).

```
