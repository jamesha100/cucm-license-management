## Introduction

Cisco Unified Communications Manager 9 introduced a user based licensing model based upon user ownership of physical and software based endpoints. This model generally works well but problems can be encountered if the ownership of devices is not configured correctly. This series of articles provides an overview of licensing and strategies to ensure that licenses are used efficiently.
These strategies are based upon using SQL database queries to collect and updated device ownership.
