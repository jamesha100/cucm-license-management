## Article 3 - Using the CUCM AXL API

Having created some SQL queries to read and update device ownership settings we are now ready to start to plan how to update the device ownership of all phone devices in the cluster. This will be done by using the CUCM AXL API to submit SQL requests and collect data. A rnage of tools such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and [CURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) may be used to interact with the AXL API. It may also be utilised by programming languages such as [Python](https://www.python.org/).
